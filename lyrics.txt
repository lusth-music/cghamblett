Verse 1
Riding through the sky on my dragon Balthazair
Flying real high feel the wind in my hair
Wave the ground goodbye, pretty soon we'll be there
We're just gonna fly to the dragon's lair

Chorus
Dragon, Dragon scales a deep dark blue
Great big leathery wings teeth are shiny too
Dragon, dragon take me to the moon
Balthazair you're so cool enough to make the ladies swoon

Verse 2
Fly into the light, till we reach the lair's core
Gold is shining bright, jewelled shields and sharpened swords
I think I we just might take a nap cause we are so bored
But this guy showed up he wants to fight for the treasure horde

Chorus

Riding on the dragon
My motherfucking dragon

Verse 3
His body weak and frail, his beard merely a wisp
He climbed upon the tail and spoke with a stupid lisp
"Im not gonna fail and you'll cease to exist"
Balthazair exhaled and he burnt him to a crisp

Chorus

Verse 4
Im feeling rather ill, that trip did me much wear
Lets take a nap here still, and then see how I fare
He agreed, "I've had my fill", and lay down without care
And thats how I was killed, crushed by my friend Balthazair
